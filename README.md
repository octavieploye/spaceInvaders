Hello World,

Thank you for visiting this page.

You will find here the code for a SpaceInvaders Game I created one month after I started the coding BootCamp with General Assembly. Hence few bits to improve and learn here and there still ,I'm proud of it as to be honest I have never code/program before except for the usual styling HTML and CSS.

This was on another level and manipulating Vanilla Javascript functions and DOM was not an easy task as you can imagine. Speak about learning a completly foreign language with its syntax, its grammar, its rules and own thoughts and logic.
